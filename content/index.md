            I'm Janosch, an electrical engineer specializing in systems and automation technology based in Germany. My professional journey has been shaped by a strong aversion to repetitive tasks and a genuine passion for automation.
        </p><p>
            With a solid foundation in programming, I've honed my skills in areas such as DevOps, interoperability, regulatory requirements, sensor technology, and control systems. The practical application of my knowledge extends to a dedicated homelab, where I continuously explore new concepts and technologies.
        </p><p>
            Beyond my technical pursuits, I've applied my automation mindset to my living space. I meticulously planned and built my home, transforming it into a fully automated smart environment, reflecting not only my technological interests but also my commitment to efficiency in daily life.
        </p><p>
            My primary focus and passion lie in the field of medical technology, where I see automation as a crucial element in addressing contemporary challenges within the healthcare system. Join me as we explore the practical applications of automation in the medical domain and discuss how technology can play a role in shaping a more efficient and effective future for healthcare. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing insights and experiences in the intersection of engineering and practical automation.

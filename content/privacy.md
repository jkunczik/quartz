I am offering this website to share my knowledge. I do not track and evaluate personal information from you. However, in order to serve my content to visitors, I have to process personal data, such as:

- Public IP address
- Access time
- User-Agent (information about your browser)

I am doing so to fulfill a contract with you ([Art. 6 lit. b GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). The definition of a contract is as follows:

> A contract is an agreement between two parties that creates an obligation to perform (or not perform) a particular duty.

By requesting my site, we are entering into an agreement that creates an obligation for me to deliver it to you. This is only possible if I process your request, which contains the above-mentioned personal data.

The data is also processed in my legitimate interest ([Art. 6 lit. f GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)) to protect my site and my servers from malicious entities. For this reason, the data is evaluated and stored for no longer than 31 days to be able to block malicious requests and to provide forensic data.

You are entitled to request all personal data that has been collected (but not yet been deleted) from you. If you don't want to share this data with me, please don't visit this site.
